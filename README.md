The server serves as the source of information for the [website](https://github.com/skogkursbachelor/website), providing map data for the website to visualize. This includes aggregation of different map data sources to create the forestry road layer, as well as forwarding WMS data to the website.

For a full overview, read the [thesis](https://github.com/skogkursbachelor/thesis).
